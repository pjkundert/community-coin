* Executive Summary

The Community-Coin project proposes a revolutionary approach to local currency systems that enables
communities to create sound money backed by real wealth, without the burden of interest-bearing
debt.

Unlike traditional debt-based fiat currencies, Community-Coin allows individuals and businesses to
create currency units by attesting ownership of real assets (property, equipment, inventory, etc.)
while retaining full use of those assets. This creates a stable, value-backed currency that improves
business financial health and provides communities with monetary sovereignty. ([[./README.pdf][PDF]], [[./README.txt][Text]])

** Key Innovation: Interest-Free Wealth Monetization

Traditional banking requires you to either:
- Sell your assets to get money (losing the asset)
- Borrow against assets and pay interest (wealth transfer to banks)

Community-Coin enables a third option:
- Attest ownership of assets to create currency units while keeping full use of your wealth
- No interest payments - only the obligation to redeem currency if you sell the underlying asset

* Alberta Government Communications

The project has been presented to the Alberta Government as a potential "Alberta Buck" community currency system. Communications include:

Most recent comprehensive proposal incorporating lessons learned and addressing regulatory considerations.

* Technical Approach

** Phase 1: Cryptocurrency Payment Rails
Immediate deployment of existing crypto payment options (Bitcoin Lightning, Ethereum L2) to establish payment infrastructure and user familiarity.

** Phase 2: Centralized Wealth Attestation
Initial Community-Coin implementation with trusted community authorities for asset valuation and insurance claims processing.

** Phase 3: Full Decentralization  
Migration to fully decentralized Holochain-based system with algorithmic asset attestation and distributed insurance adjudication.

* Economic Benefits

Analysis using the Altman Z-Score demonstrates that businesses using Community-Coin for liquidity instead of debt financing can improve their credit rating by up to 2 full S&P ratings levels, due to:

- Improved working capital ratios (no interest burden)
- Higher retained earnings (no interest payments)  
- Better debt-to-equity ratios (currency creation vs. borrowing)

* Implementation Timeline

- **Year 1**: Aggressive R&D and prototype development ($1M investment)
- **Year 2**: Break-even through insurance fee revenue 
- **Year 3**: Profitable operations with automated fee structures

* Getting Involved

Whether you're interested in:
- **Investing** in the project development
- **Joining** the technical development team  
- **Participating** in community discussions
- **Piloting** the system in your business or community

We encourage engagement at your earliest opportunity, as the window for meaningful monetary system reform may be closing.
