1 Executive Summary
═══════════════════

  Alberta faces a critical juncture where transforming its monetary
  system from debt-based to wealth-backed money creation could eliminate
  over $20 billion in annual interest payments currently extracted from
  the provincial economy.  This paper examines the profound economic
  implications of enabling Albertans to create money by attesting their
  existing wealth rather than borrowing at interest, demonstrating how
  this shift would fundamentally improve household finances, business
  competitiveness, and provincial fiscal capacity.

  The analysis reveals that transitioning to wealth-backed money
  creation would reduce the effective cost of home ownership by over
  40%, eliminate the interest burden that at times forces up to a third
  of Alberta farms to operate at a loss, and free up over $3 billion
  annually in provincial debt servicing for productive investment.

  These benefits flow from a simple principle: when money is created
  through wealth attestation rather than debt origination, the interest
  burden that currently transfers wealth from producers to financial
  intermediaries disappears, leaving that value in the hands of Alberta
  families and businesses.

  Alberta loses $63 million /daily/ to interest payments on money banks
  create from nothing. A $10 million R&D investment could end this
  wealth extraction permanently.


2 Introduction: The Hidden Cost of Debt-Based Money
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════

  Every dollar circulating in Alberta's economy originated as someone's
  debt to a bank.  When an Alberta family takes out a mortgage, the bank
  creates new money by typing numbers into an account, as Werner (2014)
  [1] empirically demonstrated.  The family provides real collateral -
  their future home - and commits to decades of interest payments, while
  the bank risks /no/ existing assets and creates the loan principal
  from nothing through accounting entries.

  This system imposes a hidden tax on every economic transaction in
  Alberta.  The province's households currently carry $197 billion in
  mortgage debt and pay approximately $10 billion annually in mortgage
  interest alone. Alberta businesses shoulder an additional $203 billion
  in debt with corresponding interest obligations. Meanwhile, the
  provincial government itself pays $3.2 billion yearly servicing its
  $82.8 billion debt[2]. Collectively, Albertans transfer over $23
  billion annually to financial institutions simply for the privilege of
  using money that banks create costlessly through regulatory exemption.

  The alternative - wealth-backed money creation - would enable
  Albertans to monetize their existing assets without interest
  obligations. Instead of borrowing against a home and paying interest
  for 25 years, a homeowner could verify the property's value, create
  Alberta Bucks equivalent to a portion of that value, and use those
  units for transactions while retaining full use of their property. The
  obligation would simply be to redeem the created units if selling the
  property, with no interest accumulation over time.


3 The Mechanics of Money Creation: Debt vs. Wealth
══════════════════════════════════════════════════

  Let's briefly address this claim that "Broad" money is created
  primarily by commercial bank lending.  To quote the Bank of England's
  Money in the Modern Economy (2014): [3]

  <../images/boe-broad-money.png>

  Most money circulating is indeed created through debt transactions at
  commercial banks.  But what does this really mean, in practice?


3.1 Current Debt-Based System
─────────────────────────────

  Under the existing system, money creation follows a perverse logic
  that enriches financial intermediaries at the expense of productive
  economy participants. When an Alberta farmer needs $500,000 to
  purchase equipment, the lending bank performs the following
  operations:

  The bank creates a loan asset of $500,000 representing the farmer's
  promise to repay, and simultaneously creates a $500,000 deposit
  liability. No existing bank funds move or become unavailable. The
  bank's balance sheet expands by the stroke of a pen. The farmer,
  however, pledges real collateral - perhaps the farm itself - and
  commits to paying $68,000/yr 6% annual interest, totaling $180,000
  over a 10-year term.

  The economic absurdity becomes clear when examining what each party
  contributes. The farmer provides genuine valuable consideration
  through collateral and productive labor to generate repayment
  capacity. The bank provides an accounting entry made possible solely
  by its regulatory exemption from Client Money Rules, as Werner (2014)
  [1] documented. Yet the farmer pays $180,000 for this costless bank
  operation while risking losing the collateralized assets if unable to
  maintain payments.


3.2 Wealth-Backed Alternative
─────────────────────────────

  Consider the same farmer under a wealth-backed system. The farmer owns
  $2 million in land, equipment, and stored grain. Through a wealth
  "attestation" process similar to current property assessment and title
  insurance methods, these assets are verified and valued. The farmer
  can then create Alberta Bucks equivalent to 50% [4] of the attested
  value - $1 million - while retaining full use and benefit of the
  assets.

  The critical difference emerges in the payment structure. Rather than
  paying interest to a bank, the farmer pays only insurance premiums to
  protect against asset loss; typically 0.5% to 1% annually for
  agricultural assets. On $500,000 in created money, this represents
  $2,500 to $5,000 yearly versus $30,000 in bank interest. The $25,000+
  annual difference remains in the farm operation, funding expansion,
  equipment modernization, or household consumption.

  The balance sheet operations also differ fundamentally. The farmer's
  personal balance sheet shows an asset (the pledged wealth) and a
  liability (the obligation to redeem Alberta Bucks if selling the
  asset). The provincial monetary system shows the created Alberta Bucks
  backed by the attested wealth. No interest accumulates because no
  party provided funds that became unavailable - the money was created
  through wealth attestation, not borrowed from existing pools.


4 Household Impact: Transforming Home Ownership Economics
═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

4.1 Mortgage Debt Transformation
────────────────────────────────

  Alberta households currently carry $197 billion in mortgage debt, with
  the average mortgage standing at $380,000. Under conventional
  financing at current rates around 5.5%, a family pays approximately
  $21,000 annually in interest during the first years of their
  mortgage. Over a 25-year amortization, they will pay roughly $275,000
  in interest on top of the $380,000 principal, meaning they effectively
  purchase their home 1.7 times.

  Under wealth-backed money creation, the same family would verify their
  home's ownership and value and create Alberta Bucks to purchase it
  outright. They would pay annual insurance costs of perhaps 0.2% (given
  the stability of residential real estate), or $760 yearly.  The
  obligation would be to redeem the Alberta Bucks if selling the home,
  but no interest would accumulate during ownership. The family saves
  $20,000+ annually, funds that can support local consumption, education
  investment, or business formation.

  The macroeconomic implications multiply across Alberta's 580,000
  mortgaged households. If even half transition to wealth-backed
  financing, the province retains $5.8 billion annually that currently
  flows to financial institutions. This money recirculates through local
  economies, supporting retail businesses, services, and employment
  rather than enriching distant shareholders.


4.2 Vehicle Financing Liberation
────────────────────────────────

  Alberta households also carry approximately $12 billion in vehicle
  debt, paying roughly $600 million annually in auto loan interest. The
  average vehicle loan of $35,000 at 7% interest costs $2,450 yearly in
  interest payments. Under wealth-backed creation, a family could attest
  their vehicle's value and create Alberta Bucks without interest
  obligations.

  The transformation becomes more powerful when considering that
  vehicles are depreciating assets. Under debt financing, families pay
  interest on a declining value; a form of double loss. Under
  wealth-backed creation, the obligation to redeem simply tracks the
  declining asset value, with no interest penalty compounding the
  depreciation impact. A family might pay $100 annually in insurance
  premiums versus $2,450 in interest, freeing $2,350 yearly for
  productive uses.


5 Business Impact: Debt Servitude to Productive Investment
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

5.1 Agricultural Sector Liberation
──────────────────────────────────

  Alberta's agricultural sector demonstrates the crushing weight of
  debt-based finance most starkly.  The province's farms carry $37.4
  billion [5] in debt, with average interest costs consuming a third [6]
  of the $5.7 billion in Alberta's farm cash income.  Many operations
  exist primarily to service debt rather than generate prosperity for
  farming families and their communities.

  Consider a mid-sized grain operation with $3 million in land, $1
  million in equipment, and typically $500,000 in stored grain
  inventory. Under current financing, this farm might carry $2 million
  in debt at 5% interest paying $100,000 annually to banks. In low
  commodity price years, this interest burden often exceeds operating
  profits, forcing farmers to borrow more simply to service existing
  debt; a vicious cycle that has driven countless families from
  agriculture.

  Under wealth-backed creation, the same farm could attest its $4.5
  million in assets and create Alberta Bucks up to perhaps $2.25 million
  (at a conservative 50% ratio). Annual insurance costs might total
  $15,000 for the diversified asset base. The farm saves $85,000 yearly,
  transforming marginally viable operations into profitable
  enterprises. This difference enables equipment modernization,
  sustainable practice adoption, and succession planning that debt
  servicing currently prevents.

  The stored grain inventory presents particularly compelling
  opportunities. Farmers currently face a cruel choice: sell grain
  immediately after harvest when prices are lowest to service debt, or
  finance storage costs at interest while hoping for price
  improvement. With wealth-backed creation, farmers could attest stored
  grain value, create Alberta Bucks for immediate needs, and redeem
  those units when selling at optimal prices. This breaks the
  debt-driven cycle that forces farmers to accept unfavorable prices,
  improving both farm income and market price stability.


5.2 Small Business Renaissance
──────────────────────────────

  Alberta's 170,000 small businesses collectively carry over $40 billion
  in debt, with interest costs representing a major barrier to growth
  and innovation. A typical small manufacturer with $2 million in
  equipment and $500,000 in inventory might pay $125,000 annually
  servicing debt; often exceeding the owner's salary.

  Under wealth-backed creation, the same business could attest its
  equipment and inventory, creating Alberta Bucks for working capital
  without interest obligations. Insurance costs of perhaps $10,000
  annually replace $125,000 in interest payments. The $115,000
  difference funds hiring, research and development, or market expansion
  that debt servicing currently prevents.

  The transformative potential extends beyond cost savings. Currently,
  banks prefer lending against real estate rather than productive
  assets, forcing businesses to leverage personal homes for commercial
  credit. Wealth-backed creation values productive assets directly:
  manufacturing equipment, inventory, intellectual property; aligning
  capital creation with productive capacity rather than real estate
  speculation.


6 Provincial Fiscal Revolution
══════════════════════════════

6.1 Eliminating Public Debt Servicing
─────────────────────────────────────

  Alberta currently allocates $3.2 billion annually to debt servicing;
  funds extracted from public services and infrastructure
  investment. This represents $700 per Albertan [7] yearly, or $2,800
  for a family of four, transferred to bondholders rather han invested
  in provincial development.

  Under wealth-backed creation, Alberta could monetize its vast public
  assets without debt obligations. The Heritage Savings Trust Fund's $30
  billion value alone could back substantial Alberta Buck creation.
  Crown lands valued at over $100 billion provide additional backing
  capacity.  Resource royalty streams, worth $21 billion annually, offer
  further monetization potential without debt accumulation.

  The province could fund a decade-long infrastructure modernization
  program by creating Alberta Bucks backed by the very infrastructure
  being built. A $50 billion program for schools, hospitals, and
  renewable energy would typically cost $75 billion including interest
  over 20 years. Through wealth-backed creation, Alberta pays only the
  actual $50 billion construction cost plus modest insurance premiums,
  saving $25 billion that remains available for additional public
  investment.


6.2 Resource Revenue Optimization
─────────────────────────────────

  Alberta's resource wealth currently generates provincial revenue
  through royalties and taxes, but the full value potential remains
  uncaptured.  The province's revenue share of proven oil reserves,
  valued conservatively at $2 trillion, could back massive Alberta Buck
  creation for sovereign wealth fund expansion, economic
  diversification, and citizen dividends.

  Instead of borrowing against future resource revenues at interest,
  Alberta could create money backed by it's claim on proven reserves,
  invest those funds productively, and redeem the units as resources are
  extracted. This transforms resources from a depleting inheritance into
  a perpetual prosperity engine, as investment returns compound while
  redemption obligations remain fixed.


7 Implementation Urgency: The R&D Imperative
════════════════════════════════════════════

  Stablecoins backed by USD debt instruments are exploding in use
  globally [8].  Simultaneously, the Government of Canada is restricting
  access to crypto technology, preventing similar CAD based instruments,
  and crippling CAD denominated projects and jurisdictions by
  restricting them from benefiting from the improvements in operational
  efficiency and access to funding provided by these technologies.

  Alberta is uniquely positioned to establish itself as a global leader
  in this field, by offering the world's first Stablecoin backed by a
  stable, secure and unencumbered /basket of valuable commodities/,
  instead of volatile and risky /foreign debt instruments/.

  To accomplish this, Alberta must immediately initiate a comprehensive
  research and development program to prototype wealth-backed money
  creation systems.  The technical foundation exists through recently
  discovered failure-resilient distributed ledger technologies and
  established asset attestation methods and constitutionally protected
  legal remedies, but integration and testing require dedicated
  resources and expertise.

  We have home-grown Alberta talent with a proven track record of
  building continent-spanning industrial automation.  It is time to
  apply this Alberta Advantage to the /next generation/ of wealth
  expanding technology: Wealth-backed instead of Debt-backed
  Stablecoins.


7.1 Prototype Development Requirements
──────────────────────────────────────

  The prototype system must demonstrate several critical
  capabilities. Asset attestation mechanisms must accurately value
  diverse wealth types from real estate to agricultural inventory while
  preventing fraud and double-pledging. The distributed ledger must
  process transactions at commercial speeds while maintaining security
  and auditability. Integration with existing payment systems must be
  seamless to encourage adoption. Regulatory frameworks must ensure
  compliance while preserving system benefits.

  A two-year, $10 million R&D program could deliver a functional initial
  pilot program.  This investment would be recouped within /months/
  through reduced debt servicing costs once operational. Delay, however,
  costs Alberta $23 billion annually in unnecessary interest payments:
  over $63 million /daily/ transferred from productive economy to
  financial intermediaries.

  The cost/benefit ratios are compelling: for roughly 15% of the current
  *daily* losses paid to intermediaries, Alberta could position itself
  to have a globally unique offering: proven expertise in Wealth-backed
  Stablecoin technology, implementation and adoption.

  Albertans could begin seeing economic benefits within 1 or 2 years.
  Within 2 or 3 years, global demand for secure Stablecoins to underpin
  corporate and government treasuries could create demand for Alberta
  Bucks far beyond even domestic usage.  There is a real possibility
  that Alberta's vast commodity, energy and farming wealth could become
  a global reserve asset – if we choose to make it available to the
  world!


7.2 Pilot Program Opportunities
───────────────────────────────

  Strategic pilot implementations could demonstrate system viability
  while generating immediate benefits.  Agricultural communities facing
  acute debt stress present /ideal/ initial deployment opportunities. A
  pilot program focused on Alberta family farming operations could
  enable farmers to attest grain inventories and equipment, creating
  Alberta Bucks for operational expenses while retaining assets for
  production.

  Small business districts in Calgary, Edmonton or Grande Prairie could
  pilot commercial applications, enabling businesses to monetize
  inventory and equipment for working capital without interest
  obligations. The immediate cash flow improvement would benefit many
  small businesses while identifying areas needing refinements.

  Municipal governments could pilot infrastructure financing through
  wealth-backed Buck creation, funding community projects by attesting
  public assets rather than issuing interest-bearing bonds. A single
  $100 million municipal infrastructure program could save $50 million
  in interest costs over 20 years, providing compelling evidence for
  provincial-scale adoption.


7.3 Scaling to Provincial Implementation
────────────────────────────────────────

  Following successful pilots, provincial implementation requires
  coordinated development across multiple fronts.  Legislative
  frameworks must establish asset attestation standards, insurance
  requirements, and redemption procedures. Technical infrastructure must
  scale to support millions of users and billions in transaction
  volume. Educational programs must help Albertans understand and
  utilize the new system effectively.

  The implementation timeline could achieve /meaningful/ impact within
  2-3 years. Year one focuses on R&D and prototype development. Year two
  implements agricultural and small business pilots. Year three expands
  to municipal government participation. Year four enables broad
  consumer adoption for mortgages and vehicle financing. Year five
  achieves full provincial integration including government finance
  transformation.

  With urgent concerted effort and focus, however, Alberta /could/
  implement this project on a much more rapid time frame.  The
  cryptographic and distributed system tools are now available to build
  a prototype that is usable by technically savvy, willing, private
  communities of crypto-friendly asset holders.  The legal frameworks
  exist to create private asset-backed tokens that represent attested
  (verified and insured) wealth ownership, and the constitutionally
  protected private contractual guarantees, liens and other legal
  remedies required to implement the necessary insurance tools are
  regularly exercised and sound.

  Alberta can rise to this challenge, and summon the will, effort and
  funding to achieve rapid prototyping, testing and operation.  We
  Albertans understand complex obstacles, set ambitious goals, and then
  /get things done./


8 Conclusion: Alberta's Historic Opportunity
════════════════════════════════════════════

  Alberta stands at a pivotal moment where technological capability,
  economic necessity, and political possibility converge to enable
  fundamental monetary reform. The province currently hemorrhages $23
  billion annually in interest payments that extract value without
  providing corresponding benefit. This represents the province's entire
  health care budget, or sufficient funds to eliminate provincial income
  tax while still having billions available for infrastructure
  investment.

  The transition from debt-based to wealth-backed money creation would
  transform every aspect of Alberta's economy. Families would retain
  thousands annually currently lost to mortgage and loan
  interest. Farmers would escape the debt trap that forces agricultural
  consolidation and rural depopulation. Businesses would access capital
  based on productive capacity rather than real estate
  collateral. Government would fund development through wealth
  attestation rather than debt accumulation.

  The technical mechanisms exist. The legal frameworks are
  achievable. The economic benefits are quantifiable and massive. What
  remains is the political will to challenge entrenched financial
  interests and implement systems serving Albertans rather than
  extracting from them.

  Every day of delay costs Alberta $63 million in unnecessary interest
  payments. Every year of inaction transfers $23 billion from productive
  economy to financial intermediaries. The government's responsibility
  to pursue ths transformation is not merely important: it is urgent,
  essential, and historically imperative. Alberta must act now to
  prototype, prove, and implement wealth-backed money creation, or
  condemn future generations to perpetual debt servitude when liberation
  lies within reach.

  The choice is stark: continue enriching distant financial institutions
  through interest payments on money they create from nothing, or enable
  Albertans to create money backed by their own real wealth while
  retaining value within provincial communities. The moral, economic,
  and practical arguments align /unequivocally/: Alberta must pioneer
  wealth-backed money creation to secure its economic sovereignty and
  prosperity.
